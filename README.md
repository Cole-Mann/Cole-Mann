# Cole-Mann
My first repository
My name is William Colvin Mann, Sr. 
I go by "Cole", a shortened version of my middle name, Colvin.
If I am not the oldest student presently attending Ivy Tech I know I am close to being the oldest.  I will turn 70 on Flag Day.  In my earlier life I earned a BA from Purdue in West Lafayette with a degree in technical communication.  I also studied television and film writing at UCLA.  I have worked in various forms of commercial media all of my life.  Since 1993 I have owned a small business marketing and advertisng company called Better Merchants (bettermerchants.com).  This SDEV255 is my fourth consecutive Ivy Tech class since returning.  These tired, old brain cells can make learning new things very challenging, yet, so far, I have managed to earn three consecutive A's in my courese.  Even if it takes me three times more work that it takes my younger fellow students I am still most proud of being able to earn these A's.
